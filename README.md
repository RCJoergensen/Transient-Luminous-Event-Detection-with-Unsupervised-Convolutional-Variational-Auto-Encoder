# Transient-Luminous-Event-Detection-with-Unsupervised-Convolutional-Variational-Auto-Encoder
Project repository for course Deep Learning (02456) - Fall 2020. Authors: Søren C.W. Engell (s165318) and Rasmus C. Jørgensen (s164044)

The main jupytor notebook is found in DeepLearningProject_FinalVersion. The two additional files, ASIM_DataLoader_Slicing_Func.py and ReadMMIAfits_OCRE.py,
are used for loading the raw fits files provided by ASIM, and reading them, respectively. Both are necessary to read the data and run the notebook.

Please be aware of local paths, such as where to load the files, and where to save figures.
Additionally, be aware of possible problems with ReadMMIAfits_OCRE.py, as described in the notebook. 

The raw data files are NOT included in this repository, as they are not publicly available as of now.
